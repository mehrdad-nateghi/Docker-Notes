### 1. What is docker? ###

### 2. What do we have problems without docker? ###
> The app works on my machine but doesn't work somewhere.
> 1. One or more files are missing and the app is not entirely deployed
> 2. Software version mismatch
> 3. Different configuration settings
### 3. With docker we can easily ... our application with everything it needs and run it anywhere on any machine with docker. ex? ###
> package
>
> - package 1 : node 14, mongo 4, app
> - package 2: node 13, mongo 3, app

### 5. After run: docker-compose up, docker will automatically download and run this dependency inside an isolated environment called a ... ###
